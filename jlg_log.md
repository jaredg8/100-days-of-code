# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: December 29, 2017
##### (Airport/Tokyo <1 hour)

**Today's Progress**: Committed to 100 days of code - already about 4 days of continuous code working on my webpage www.jaredguyer.io.  Today I built the skills section using CSS Grid and Flexbox.  I included icons as well.  

**Thoughts:** My main issue is making it responsive.  It looks fine for desktop, but as soon as I look at it on mobile it gets all messed up.  I need to figure out media queries and also suspect the way I've structured my containers is not for the best.

### Day 1: December 30, 2017 
##### (Tokyo feeling jetlagged < 1 hour)

**Today's Progress**: Watched Treehouse videos on CSS layouts, still not sure why site is not responsive.  Signed up for CodePen and played around.  I also mocked up a design for brother's website in Figma.

**Thoughts**: I just need to figure out the responsive bit and then I can push the newest commit to prod.  Really need to figure it out so I can get started with my freelance stuff.

### Day 2: December 31, 2017 Sunday
##### (Tokyo - Morning did flexbox activities; evening worked on homepage }

**Today's Progress**: flexbox-froggy is awesome.  I have a much better understanding now. I worked on my profile page and refactored the code to make it more clean.  Spent time in Renoir coffee shop updating flexbox to refactor a lot of the flexbox related css and media queries.  Clearly media queries are the key for responsiveness.  I need to figure out how to best do media queries for mobile.  

**Thoughts**: Need to do same version of flex froggy for CSS grid.  Need to improve on media queries.  Need to keep code more organized and probably split css files into multiple and import into a base file.  Feel simultaneously happy with progress and frustrated on how much farther I still have to go.

### Day 3: January 1, 2018 Monday
##### (Tokyo - Morning did CSS Grid activities; }

**Today's Progress**: Did CSS Garden and worked on homepage.

**Thoughts**: I'm actually thinking that I might want to use CSS grid for whole layout besides for banner and footer section of my homepage.  I might try a 6x6 grid and leave columns and rows 1 & 6 as margins and then have 4 columns and rows for content.  I might give it a try on Sage Digital's homepage to see how it works.  Also realizing I should use percentages and em more frequently to improve responsiveness.
