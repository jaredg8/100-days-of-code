# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: December 29, 2017
##### (Airport/Tokyo <1 hour)

**Today's Progress**: Committed to 100 days of code - already about 4 days of continuous code working on my webpage www.jaredguyer.io.  Today I built the skills section using CSS Grid and Flexbox.  I included icons as well.  

**Thoughts:** My main issue is making it responsive.  It looks fine for desktop, but as soon as I look at it on mobile it gets all messed up.  I need to figure out media queries and also suspect the way I've structured my containers is not for the best.

### Day 1: December 30, 2017 
##### (Tokyo feeling jetlagged < 1 hour)

**Today's Progress**: Watched Treehouse videos on CSS layouts, still not sure why site is not responsive.  Signed up for CodePen and played around.  I also mocked up a design for brother's website in Figma.

**Thoughts**: I just need to figure out the responsive bit and then I can push the newest commit to prod.  Really need to figure it out so I can get started with my freelance stuff.
